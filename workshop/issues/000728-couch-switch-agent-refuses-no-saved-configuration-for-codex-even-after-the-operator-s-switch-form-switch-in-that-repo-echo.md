# couch --switch-agent refuses 'no saved configuration for codex' even after the operator's switch-form switch in that repo (echo)

## Problem

ops-echo:0 (10-20 ~09:20): `couch --switch-agent echo:2 --agent codex --confirm` refuses with "no saved configuration
for codex; the operator must configure it in the switch form first" (requests 8e69e8d8 and 0ad9d2c3), and still
refused after the operator switched echo:0 to Codex by hand in the switch form. So the form's switch doesn't save the
per-repo configuration the CLI reads (or saves it under a key the CLI doesn't look up). In the devinfra repos the
same CLI switch worked (ariadne:0, ariadne:5, parley.nvim:3, :4 on 10-20), so a saved codex configuration exists there.

## Spec

Find where the switch form records its agent configuration and where `--switch-agent` reads it; make a successful
form switch leave the configuration the CLI needs (same key, same repo scope), or have the CLI fall back to the
agent's last successful launch configuration in that repo. The refusal names exactly what's missing and where.

## Done when

- A form-driven switch in a repo without prior CLI config, followed by a CLI switch on another slot of that repo,
  succeeds (test against the stateful fake/store).
- echo:2 and echo:3 switch to Codex by CLI live.

## Plan

## Log

### 2026-10-20

## Log

- 10-20 10:05 (TL): same refusal in a devinfra repo: `couch --switch-agent ariadne:4 --agent codex --confirm` →
  "no saved configuration for codex; the operator must configure it in the switch form first", although the same
  command succeeded on ariadne:0 and ariadne:5 an hour earlier. So the saved configuration looks per slot (or per
  launch history), not per repo: a slot that never ran Codex has none.
- 10-20 14:15 (TL): third case: the operator's switch-form switch of pair:8 (Qoder → Codex) failed with
  "switch-agent: source changed or disconnected; retry switch" (launch-diagnostics failures.json, operation
  2e048ac2508c98354822c8fa342aa0e3). pair:8's Qoder session was a recording only (no live wrapper). The switch should
  handle a parked or disconnected source (start fresh on the new agent) instead of refusing.
- 10-20 21:15 (TL, operator report): there is no way to change a running Codex slot's startup parameters and restart
  it. Choosing the switch form with the **same** agent shows a parameters box, but the box **accepts no keyboard
  input**. Scope for this issue now: (1) the parameters box in the switch form takes input; (2) "restart with new
  parameters" for the same agent is a supported path (form and CLI: `couch --switch-agent repo:N --agent codex
  --agent-args '…' --confirm` on the current agent), saved as that agent's remembered arguments; (3) the earlier cases
  (no saved configuration; a parked or disconnected source). Operator-facing; the operator hits it now.
