# Harden one-shot zellij actions against misrouted replies (zellij 0.45.1 client-ID reuse, pair#640): unknown on mismatch, confirm before mutating, clipboard fails closed

## Problem

## Spec

Operator decision, 2026-10-17: harden Pair and Couch against zellij 0.45.1's reply misrouting (pair#640) on our side. There's no local zellij build. Pick up the upstream fix (zellij PR #5630, "do not reuse client ids", merged but unreleased) when it ships.

Background, from pair#640: a reused client ID lets a late cleanup or reply reach the wrong connection. In a raw-request stress test about 3% of replies went to another connection. Periodic reads already recover on their next tick. One-shot actions don't. pair:1's audit on main 15d84ef7 lists them:
- layout and terminal toggles: focus or geometry from `list-panes` and `current-tab-info`;
- clipboard paste and routing, which doesn't always fail closed;
- warm resume and attach checks: `list-clients` counts;
- restart-key ownership and note anchors;
- discovery, which can silently omit a live session from a well-formed reply;
- the ownership proof's pane content.

Hardening, in this order of value:
1. A reply that doesn't fit its request counts as unknown, never as an answer: the wrong kind, a different session or pane than the one asked about, or malformed.
2. A one-shot mutation confirms with a second independent read before acting. If the reads disagree it refuses, and the user sees a refused action, not a wrong one.
3. Clipboard paths fail closed.
4. Where the protocol allows a request to carry its own correlation, use it.

No blind retries, no sleeps, no transport machinery. Reads that already re-check every tick stay as they are.

## Done when

- Each caller in pair:1's audit is classified as re-checked (no change), hardened (rule 1 and/or 2), or fail-closed (clipboard). The atlas records the table.
- A fake-zellij test per hardened caller shows that a misrouted reply of the same kind and of the wrong kind leads to refusal or unknown, never to the wrong action.
- pair:1's native reproduction, run against the real 0.45.1, shows hardened one-shot actions refusing rather than misacting.
- When zellij ships the fix, a note in the issue says to rerun the reproduction on the new version.
