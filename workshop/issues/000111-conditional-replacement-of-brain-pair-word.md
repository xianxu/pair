# conditional replacement of brain/pair word

In pair, when we set cmux workspace title, we replace brain for 🧠 and pair for another unicode. we should not do this when brain or pair is the single word. 

## Problem

The cmux workspace title convention currently replaces `brain` with `🧠` and
`pair` with `♋` unconditionally. That is useful for compound Pair session names
such as `pair-brain`, but it is wrong when the whole title is just `brain` or
`pair`: a plain shell cwd/workspace title should stay readable as the literal
repo name.

There are two active implementations of the convention:

- `cmd/internal/launcher.EmojiTitle`, used by launcher cmux renames.
- `cmd/internal/titlepoller.cmuxWorkspaceTitle`, used by the title poller heat
  ramp.

## Spec

- Replace `brain`, `book`, and `pair` only when the input title contains a
  separator/compound session form, e.g. `pair-brain` → `♋-🧠`.
- Preserve literal single-word titles: `brain` → `brain`, `pair` → `pair`,
  `book` → `book`.
- Keep the launcher and title poller on one shared pure substitution rule
  (`ARCH-DRY`, `ARCH-PURE`), so the cmux rename paths cannot drift again.

## Done when

- `EmojiTitle("pair-brain-book") == "♋-🧠-📗"` still holds.
- `EmojiTitle("brain") == "brain"`, `EmojiTitle("pair") == "pair"`, and
  `EmojiTitle("book") == "book"`.
- `cmuxWorkspaceTitle` follows the same behavior through the title poller.
- Focused Go tests cover both direct launcher formatting and title poller titles.

## Plan

- [x] Add RED tests for single-word preservation and compound replacement in
  `cmd/internal/launcher` and `cmd/internal/titlepoller`.
- [x] Extract/share the pure emoji-title rule in a neutral internal helper package
  so launcher and title poller derive from one implementation.
- [x] Verify focused packages and the wider Go suite.

## Log

### 2026-07-07
- 2026-07-07: closed — RED: go test ./cmd/internal/launcher -run TestEmojiTitle -count=1 failed on single-word brain/pair/book replacements, and failed again on repair becoming re♋ before tightening token boundaries. GREEN: go test ./cmd/internal/launcher -run TestEmojiTitle -count=1 and go test ./cmd/internal/titlepoller -run TestCmuxWorkspaceTitle -count=1 passed. Final verification: go test ./cmd/internal/launcher ./cmd/internal/titlepoller ./cmd/internal/titlefmt -count=1 passed; go test ./... passed; git diff --check passed. Atlas updated for the shared cmux titlefmt rule.; review verdict: SHIP

- Claimed and planned. Root cause: the cmux title convention uses unconditional
  `strings.ReplaceAll` in both launcher and titlepoller. The fix should be a
  shared pure rule, not two parallel conditional edits (`ARCH-DRY`,
  `ARCH-PURE`), and it must preserve both affected consumers (`ARCH-PURPOSE`).
- Plan-quality INFO tightened before implementation: the shared helper home will
  be a neutral internal package (not a launcher↔titlepoller dependency), and the
  RED tests will include single-word `book` preservation.
- RED evidence: `go test ./cmd/internal/launcher -run TestEmojiTitle -count=1`
  failed on `brain`, `pair`, and `book` single-word replacements; after adding a
  substring guard it also failed on `repair` becoming `re♋`.
- Implemented `cmd/internal/titlefmt.EmojiTitle` as the shared pure helper:
  hyphen-separated tokens are substituted, while single words and substrings
  inside larger words remain literal.
- GREEN/final verification: `go test ./cmd/internal/launcher -run TestEmojiTitle
  -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/internal/titlepoller -run TestCmuxWorkspaceTitle
  -count=1`, `go test ./cmd/internal/launcher ./cmd/internal/titlepoller
  ./cmd/internal/titlefmt -count=1`, and `go test ./...` passed.
