# pair continue: sessionView --plain, continue verb, park-nudge

## Problem

pair wraps any TUI agent and can relaunch with a different agent, but has no way
to durably hand off the *human-meaningful* state of a session. `pair resume <tag>`
restores the **native** session (same agent, same `session_id`) — machine state
that depends on the agent's own, recyclable store. There's no portable "pick this
up later / elsewhere / on another agent" path. The substrate for that already
exists in pair — the rendered scrollback (`pair-scrollback-render`) is the
cleaned-up, human-consumable projection of the session — but it's only emitted as
SGR-colored text for the Alt+/ viewer, and there's no verb to turn a session into
a durable continuation or to resume from one.

## Spec

Depends on **`ariadne#91`** (the `continuation` datatype, applied by the existing
`xx-datatype` dispatcher — there is **no** `xx-continuation` skill and **no** `sdlc
continuation new` verb). `#91` defines the format + invariants; **this issue builds
the deterministic writer that enforces them** (`cmd/pair-continuation`: render
frontmatter, allocate the timestamped collision-safe filename, write, commit+push),
plus the pair-side substrate and UX.
Principle (from `#91`): **`resume` = machine state; `continue` = human
understanding** — `pair continue` is the orthogonal sibling of `pair resume`, not
a fidelity variant.

**1. `pair-scrollback-render --plain`** — a plain-text projection of the
`sessionView` abstraction. Today the renderer replays `.raw` + resize events
through a VT100 emulator and emits one **SGR-decorated** row per logical line (for
the nvim viewer, which strips + recolors), localized to `serializeRow`. Add
`--plain` to emit `c.Content` only (skip the `Style.Diff` / `\x1b[0m` emission) →
clean rendered text straight from the emulator, no post-hoc regex strip. Two details:

- **Render full history, not the viewer window.** The default caps retained
  scrollback at `historyRows` = 2000 (matched to zellij's scroll buffer); a
  continuation wants the whole session, so `--plain` renders with an uncapped (or
  large) history. Harder limit: `.raw` is `O_TRUNC`'d every launch (`pair-wrap`),
  so it only holds the **current run** — see the dead-agent caveat in §3.
- **Trim trailing blanks.** In SGR mode a non-default background makes a
  blank-content cell "visible"; in plain mode trim each row to its last
  non-blank-*content* cell so text isn't padded to terminal width.

This is the substrate the `xx-datatype` dispatcher consumes (applying `continuation.md`). Terminal hard-wraps + box chrome
(borders, status lines, spinner frames) survive into the plain text — *asserted*
LLM-tolerable, so the `--plain` test must run over a **real captured agent `.raw`**
(not a synthetic one) and check signal-to-noise. Unwrapping/de-chroming is later polish.

**2. `pair continue [slug] [agent]`** — sibling of `pair resume`:

- bare `pair continue` → list open continuations in `workshop/continuation/`
  (slug, NEXT-ACTION one-liner, issues, age);
- `pair continue <slug>` → start a **fresh** session seeded to read the matching
  `workshop/continuation/<timestamp>-<slug>.md` (newest if several share the slug)
  and execute its NEXT ACTION; uses pair's normal launch path;
- optional `[agent]` → launch under a different stack — this is the **port**
  (e.g. `pair continue mywork codex`). The launch stack defaults to the doc's
  `agent:`, but that field is only the original/provenance agent, **not a
  constraint** — `[agent]` is the escape hatch (you often continue *off* the
  original agent precisely because it died or underperformed).

Never reads `session_id` to do a native resume — that path is `pair resume`'s
alone (keep the verbs behaviorally separate).

**3. Author trigger (produce-while-alive) — keyed on the pair tag, not the native
session id.** A session's substrate is tag-keyed: scrollback lives at
`scrollback-<tag>-<agent>.{raw,events.jsonl}` and the native `session_id` sits in
`config-<tag>-<agent>.json`. So the operation is "**continue / park
`pair-<tag>`**" — pair resolves tag → rendered transcript (`pair-scrollback-render
--plain`) + agent + the `session_id` (for provenance) **directly, no reverse
lookup** from a native session id. (You think in tags — "the robotics session" —
not in claude's `xxxx`; and the substrate is keyed that way anyway.)

No new shell verb (parking is a within-session act): inside the session the agent
already knows its `PAIR_TAG`, so "park this" applies `continuation.md` (via the
`xx-datatype` dispatcher) against the current tag's render. For the dead-agent case,
a fresh session names the tag explicitly ("park `pair-robotics`") and distills
*that* tag's scrollback. Either way the dispatcher does the distillation and the
`cmd/pair-continuation` writer (this issue) finalizes — writes the doc + commits +
pushes; pair supplies the rendered-transcript path.

*Dead-agent caveat.* The agent-alive path distills from the agent's own warm
context (the whole session). The dead-agent path distills only from on-disk
scrollback — and because `.raw` is truncated each launch, that holds the session
**since its last (re)launch**: complete for a never-reloaded run, but a long
session that reloaded loses pre-reload turns unless the agent's resume-replay had
already re-captured them. v1 accepts this; the agent-alive park (the common,
recommended case) is unaffected.

**4. Alt+x park-nudge** — `cleanup_quit_marker()` currently `rm`s the scrollback
(`.raw` / `.events.jsonl` / `.ansi`) on a true quit, discarding the only on-disk
record. Before that `rm`, prompt: "park this session as a continuation first?
(y/N)". On yes, run the author flow against the still-present scrollback. Converts
silent discard into an explicit park — directly addresses the "I don't want state
silently recycled" worry. (Reload/resume already re-capture via the agent's
resume-replay, so the nudge is the quit path specifically.)

Out of scope (v1): reading native agent stores / per-agent transcript parsers
(wrong kind of state for `continue`; see `#91`). Optional later: a raw
scrollback/native snapshot copied beside the doc for the recycling-paranoid; a
pair keybinding for the author trigger.

## Done when

- `pair-scrollback-render --plain` emits clean rendered text with full (uncapped) history; covered by render tests (escape-free plain output; `resolveMax`/`--max-lines` capping; no stray `.viewport`) + a manual signal check over a real `.raw` recorded in the Log (a real session as committed testdata raises privacy concerns).
- `pair continue` lists open continuations; `pair continue <slug>` launches a fresh session on the doc (newest match); `pair continue <slug> <agent>` ports to another stack.
- Asking a live agent to park produces a continuation doc that passes a **structural** check (frontmatter conforms to `continuation.md`'s `type.md` shape; NEXT ACTION non-empty) and is committed+pushed; distilled from the tag's scrollback. (The `cmd/pair-continuation` writer's unit + integration tests are the deterministic anchor.)
- Alt+x offers the park-nudge before scrollback is removed; declining preserves current behavior.
- Atlas: `resume` vs `continue` entry; README keybinding/verb note.

## Plan

- [x] M1 — `--plain` substrate: `serializeRow` plain mode + `--plain`/`--max-lines` on `pair-scrollback-render`; real-`.raw` signal check
- [ ] M2 — `cmd/pair-continuation` writer: pure core (frontmatter/filename/assemble/validate) + thin clock/fs/git seam; write→commit→push integration test against a temp repo with a bare origin
- [ ] M3 — pair UX: `pair continue [slug] [agent]` (list / launch / port) + Alt+x park-nudge (preserve-on-quit) + atlas/README

Detailed steps: `workshop/plans/000050-pair-continue-plan.md`.

## Log

### 2026-06-11 — M1 (`--plain` substrate)
- 2026-06-11: closed M1 — serializeRow plain mode + --plain/--max-lines; 14 renderer tests pass incl. bg/wide-grapheme regressions; gofmt/vet/build clean; real-.raw plain render escape-free + legible (signal check in Log); atlas sessionView note added.; review verdict: FIX-THEN-SHIP
- `serializeRow(line, plain bool)`: plain mode skips SGR + the trailing reset, and the trailing-blank trim is now `plain`-aware (a bg-only "visible" blank is trimmed in plain, kept in colored — the gate's Critical). `render()` + `main()` gain `--plain` and `--max-lines` (`<=0` = uncapped via `resolveMax` → `math.MaxInt32`). 14 renderer tests pass (incl. the existing bg/wide-grapheme regressions); gofmt/vet/build clean.
- **Real-`.raw` signal check (AGENTS.md §5):** rendered `~/.local/share/pair/scrollback-brain-claude.raw` (1.4 MB) with `--plain --max-lines 0` → **0 escape sequences**, 1458 lines, conversation prose contiguous and legible, `⏺` agent-turn markers preserved as useful boundaries; box/spinner chrome negligible. Signal-to-noise is good — the substrate is fit for distillation as-is (de-chroming stays deferred polish).
- **M1 boundary review fixes (FIX-THEN-SHIP, 0 Critical):** added `TestResolveMax` (table: `-1`/`0`/`5`/`2000`) + `TestRender_MaxLinesCaps` (differential capped<uncapped) for the previously-untested cap branch; guarded the `.viewport` sidecar write with `!plain` (+ a no-stray-sidecar assertion); softened the Spec Done-when wording to match the manual signal check (no real session committed as testdata — privacy). Deferred: a small *sanitized* real-`.raw` fixture (optional hardening).
