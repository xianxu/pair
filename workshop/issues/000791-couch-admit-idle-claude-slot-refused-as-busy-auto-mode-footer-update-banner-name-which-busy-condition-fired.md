# Couch admit: idle Claude slot refused as busy (auto-mode footer / update banner?); name which busy condition fired

## Problem

## Spec

From ops-echo:0 (10-21, 18:5x–20:1x): `couch --prepare echo:3 --confirm` refused three times with
`admit refused (busy) echo:3: the agent has a turn open, the composer holds text, or input was seen in the last few
seconds`, while `couch --peek echo:3` showed Claude idle at an empty `❯` prompt and `couch --actors` showed it
available. The peek footer read `⏵⏵ auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle)   ✔ Update installed · Restart to update`.

Hypothesis (unverified): the admission check doesn't recognise Claude's idle composer under the **auto mode**
footer (other Claude slots show `bypass permissions on`), or the update banner, so it falls back to "busy". Find
which of the three busy conditions fired; the refusal should name the one that did.

## Done when

- A captured screen fixture of an idle Claude composer with the auto-mode footer and the update banner is admitted as
  idle (test); the same with text in the composer is refused (test).
- The busy refusal names which condition fired (turn open / composer text / recent input).

## Plan

- [ ]

## Log
- 10-21 22:0x (ops:0): **a Codex case, possibly the same class.** parley.nvim:3 (Codex, tag 1-parley-nvim-83) idle at an
  empty `› Ask Codex to do anything` composer, but every delivery since the 21:33 Couch restart sits at "waiting for
  recognized composer" (ops:0's 9d16fde1 at position 2, behind the restart notice). Its screen differs from Codex
  slots that receive normally: a **blank line between the composer and the footer**, and the footer reads
  `⚠ 1 warning · f2 to view` (others show `⚠ 2 warnings`). Capture that screen as a second fixture.

- 10-21 ~20:40 (ops-echo:0): **cause pinned: the `✔ Update installed · Restart to update` banner** in Claude's footer
  blocks composer recognition. After the operator restarted echo:3's Claude (banner gone, auto mode still on), a
  resend delivered. While the banner showed, sends also sat at "waiting for recognized composer", `couch --relaunch`
  refused busy, and `couch --reboot` failed at recovery confirmation: "slot zellij session 1-393 kill not confirmed:
  ownership unresolved, unknown pane owner, pane has no unambiguous actual command" (operation
  e630974ef114e3fe95e51db5a22971b0, launch-diagnostics/failures.json); that reboot failure may be its own issue.
  Fixture: footer `⏵⏵ auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle)   ✔ Update installed · Restart to update`.
