# cast-sketch: live console and driver drawing with pen pressure

## Problem

Deliver the approved live drawing tool on both required surfaces: operator inside the casting Chrome and the currently granted drive-link viewer, including iPad/Apple Pencil.

## Spec

Approved design: #750, workshop/plans/000750-cast-sketch-plan.md, especially its 2026-10-20 operator approval revision. This issue implements only its assigned slice. Start from main after dependencies land; write a slice-specific execution plan and pass the SDLC gates. No stacked branches.

Drawing follows driving, exactly one drawer cast-wide: console user when control is local; current granted drive-link holder when remote. A drive link without the current seat grants no drawing. Pointer-link and view-only viewers watch; pointer-link users retain pointing. Use current driving ownership/generation as authority, not an independent multi-drawer grant system or attribution ID.

Implement acknowledged begin/chunk/end/Undo/Redo/label/status operations, exact retries, writer admission checks and a held source-moment scene on BOTH casting Chrome and remote drawer. Label is required on leaving the tool, Undo/Redo affect the current sketch only, colour is fixed per sketch, one anchor per stroke. Old-author metadata-only label finalization may survive a handoff but never grants drawing or blocks the new holder. No takeover after expired link/session.

Casting Chrome controls use the privileged excluded isolated-world host and recorder binding, with bounded private snapshot/asset transport; no page script receives credentials/bindings. Reuse the shared sketch UI/renderer and existing snapshot/asset seams; this slice does not depend on the later headless CLI exporter.

Support pen Pointer Events and normalized pressure, coalesced samples, pointer capture, hover exclusion, release/cancel handling and deterministic mouse/touch fallback. Stream partial strokes to observers before pointer-up. Grant/revoke/release/leave/reset must seal prior accepted work and fence old-generation queued writes before enabling the next drawer. Pause/end/reconnect/expiry, backpressure, limits and failure UI follow the approved state model.

Primary surfaces: board/{sketch.go,sketch_authority.go,sketch_wire.go,writer.go,operator.go,operator_view.go}, recorder/{sketch.go,operator.go}, server_sketch.go, cast.go, browser.go, operator.js, operator_script.go, web/{sketch.js,sketch-policy.js,sketch-scene.js,sketch.css,viewer.js,annotate.js,annotation-placement.js}.

## Done when

- Two-viewer test observes first incomplete stroke before drawer pointer-up; Undo/Redo change everyone’s overlay and preserve replay history.
- Real casting-Chrome operator can draw in its held scene, label on leave and Undo/Redo; currently granted drive-link drawer can do the same.
- Pointer/view links and ungranted drive links cannot draw; pointer-link pointing still works.
- Held-write tests force every driving handoff across admission/queue/sink/reply and prove one drawer, old-generation refusal, retained partial evidence and independent pending-label completion.
- Pen pressure survives live transport; coalesced samples, hover/cancel/release and mouse/touch fallbacks are covered. Budget, source synchronization, exact retries and N/2N counters pass.
- README/atlas map the controls and recovery. Required checks/review pass, and TL-arranged real console input smoke succeeds before landing.

## Plan

- [ ] Claim/start-plan after dependencies land; write the slice-specific execution plan.
- [ ] Implement and verify the Spec and Done when through the normal SDLC gates.
