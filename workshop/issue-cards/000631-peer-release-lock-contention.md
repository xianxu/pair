# Peer promotion holds broker lock during wrapper release RPC

## Problem

During #629 investigation, Broker.promote was found calling the wrapper endpoint's Release RPC while holding the shared broker mutex on its error path. A slow Release can delay independent recipients' Send and Status calls until the RPC timeout.

This is a separate static finding. No retained evidence ties this lock contention to the 2026-10-16 17:37–18:22 hub outage; #629's confirmed mechanism is serial pre-paste expiry.
