# Lift the #863 skip on #830 native wake test (TestDisposableCouchFleetWake)

## Problem

#830's native acceptance test `TestDisposableCouchFleetWake` (cmd/couch/fleet_acceptance_test.go, in `make test-couch-fleet`) is skipped with a reason naming pair#863. #863 landed as PR 586 at 109986901: fresh-namespace startup now starts both configured hubs automatically, while a known prior shutdown still keeps them parked. The skip is now the only thing stopping the run (TL: pair:6 owns lifting it).
