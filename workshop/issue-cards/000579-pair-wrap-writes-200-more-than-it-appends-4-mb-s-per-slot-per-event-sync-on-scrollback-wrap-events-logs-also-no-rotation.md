# pair wrap writes ~200× more than it appends (~4 MB/s per slot): per-event sync on scrollback/wrap-events logs; also no rotation

## Problem

2026-10-15 (operator's system monitor): each `pair wrap` process (`--scrollback-log …/scrollback-1-<tag>-codex.raw`)
**writes 3.4–4.1 MB/s to disk**, about 29 MB/s total for the fleet (~2.5 TB/day of write wear). Yet the files it
writes grow only **~17 KB/s** (`wrap-events-1-<tag>.jsonl`) and **~2.3 KB/s** (`scrollback-…raw`) per active slot,
measured over 10 s. That's a **~200× write amplification**, most likely a sync (fsync/F_FULLFSYNC) or a re-open per
small event write, so every few-hundred-byte append costs whole blocks plus filesystem journal writes. It's also likely
behind the FSEvents daemon's ~200% CPU seen on 10-14.

Separately, these files are **never rotated**: wrap-events logs of **3.9 GB** (pair-8), **2.6 GB** (pair-43), 1.9 GB,
1.7 GB, 1.0 GB; the pair data dir was 57 GB on 10-14.
