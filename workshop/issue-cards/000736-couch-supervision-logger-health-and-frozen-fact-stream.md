# Couch supervision logger health and frozen fact stream

## Problem

During pair#735 investigation, Couch's supervision facts at ~/.local/share/pair/couch/supervision.jsonl were confirmed frozen since 2026-10-19 15:56:04 (26,061,670 bytes). Archived diagnostic segments do exist; there is no replacement per-message readiness-decision log. Existing facts record slot snapshots and completed hub deliveries.

The logger discards its Open error and becomes permanently unavailable for that supervisor lifetime. Write errors increment a dropped counter without exposing the error. Current metadata matches the frozen file. Scratch-copy Open/Write probes pass, both with writer registrations removed and retained, so the historical failure cannot be attributed from disk. Live writer PID/start matches metadata. No live files were mutated during investigation.
