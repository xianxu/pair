# Couch tells the hub about slot lifecycle events (start, park, relaunch, exit, recovery) as system messages

## Problem

The hub (TL) isn't told about slot lifecycle events. When the operator parks a slot (Alt+n), relaunches it, brings a
new slot up (parley.nvim:3 on 2026-10-15), or a slot's agent exits, the TL learns it only by polling `couch --actors`,
by peeking, or from a worker's own report. Tonight's evidence: stalled slots went unnoticed for hours, and messages to a
relaunched slot were lost. The reverse direction already exists: on connect, Couch sends a worker a "Couch restarted
and the hub is available…" notice, attributed to ops:0.
