# Recover park inventory exceeds CLI admission deadline

## Problem

On the operator build containing #651, confirmed CLI recover-park can time out before receiving a receipt because it builds the full fleet inventory inside a two-second admission exchange. The same inventory during ordinary resume preparation took 3.055 and 5.233 seconds. Two requests returned context deadline exceeded / outcome uncertain, but caller-scoped operation-status returned unknown for both; neither recovery ran. This strands an otherwise recoverable interrupted park behind its named CLI recovery command.
