# Couch resource sampler: per-slot CPU, memory and disk writes, orphan detection, threshold alerts, couch --resources

## Problem

Every resource incident so far was noticed by a human seeing a slow or full machine: a 22 GB orphan `nvim --embed`,
fseventsd at ~90 GB, #579's 61× write amplification (System Monitor), the scratch volume filling, the 15 s ledger
decode (#584). Nothing measures resource use per slot, so problems surface days late.

Part of the ops project resource-observability (`ops/teams/devinfra/projects/resource-observability/project.md`).
