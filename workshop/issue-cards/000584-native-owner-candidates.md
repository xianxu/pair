# Native owner scan blocks fleet resume on unrelated processes

## Problem

#556 native-owner admission blocks Resume from disk fleet-wide on macOS. It requires command evidence for every process before filtering Pair wrappers. Real live root services return EINVAL for kern.procargs2 and are omitted from the command snapshot; zombies and process-table churn also leave metadata without command evidence. Two read-only probes reproduced the exact refusal with 205–207 missing entries. ariadne:5 is parked with a proven native binding but cannot resume.
