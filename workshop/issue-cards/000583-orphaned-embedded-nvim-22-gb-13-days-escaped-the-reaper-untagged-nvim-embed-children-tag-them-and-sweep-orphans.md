# Orphaned embedded nvim (22 GB, 13 days) escaped the reaper: untagged 'nvim --embed' children; tag them and sweep orphans

## Problem

2026-10-15: an orphaned `nvim --embed` (pid 15395, started 2026-10-02, cwd `worktree/ariadne-slot2/ariadne`, parent
`launchd`) had grown to **22 GB** over 13 days, contributing to 63 GB of swap. pair already reaps leftover embedded
nvims (`launcher/osruntime.go` ~L945–970: it scans for `nvim … --embed` and reaps those whose slot tag isn't live),
but it only recognises processes whose argv carries a slot tag (`scope.TagFromNvimEmbedArgv`). This one's argv was bare
`nvim --embed`, so it was invisible to the reaper. Whatever spawned it (a review pane, a GUI client or a test harness)
exited without closing it.
