# Lifecycle primitives: transcript binding on the record, the two-kind address, proven teardown

## Problem

pair#684 (one lifecycle mechanism for every slot path) was planned with five milestones. Its first two are the shared primitives: the transcript binding stored on the record, the two-kind lifecycle address, and proven teardown. pair#694 (Couch teams) needs them on main before its team-lifecycle milestone. The hub decided (2026-10-18) to split them into their own issue. That keeps one issue per branch, with no landing in the middle of an issue, and lets both #684's remaining milestones and #694's M3 build from main.
