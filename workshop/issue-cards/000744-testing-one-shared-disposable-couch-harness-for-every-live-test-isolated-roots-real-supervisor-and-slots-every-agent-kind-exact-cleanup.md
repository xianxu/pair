# testing: one shared disposable-Couch harness for every live test (isolated roots, real supervisor and slots, every agent kind, exact cleanup)

## Problem

Live tests each build their own disposable Couch: pair#722's three-slot drain matrix, pair#726's held-cold resumes,
pair#740's global park, pair#741's hub-resume conformance, and pair#743's conformance in a VM. Each reinvents
isolation (state folder, socket namespace, HOME, queue root) and cleanup, and a mistake in any of them can touch the
live fleet. Operator, 10-20 (ops side doc `2026-10-20-19-conformance-structure.md`, decision 1): one shared harness.
