# Build and test with -trimpath so worktrees share the Go build cache

## Problem

On 2026-10-15 the shared Go build cache (`GOCACHE=/Volumes/AgentScratch/go-build`) filled the 186 GB scratch volume
(184 GB), failing every slot's suite. Main multiplier: builds embed each worktree's absolute source path, so the same
package is cached separately for each of ~20 slot worktrees; after a `go clean -cache`, ~30 GB came back within
minutes. The operator approved building with `-trimpath`.
