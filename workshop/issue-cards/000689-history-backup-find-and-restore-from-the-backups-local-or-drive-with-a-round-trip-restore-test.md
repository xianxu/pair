# history backup: find and restore from the backups (local or Drive), with a round-trip restore test

## Problem

pair archive can create and upload backups (continuous pass, Drive sink #678) but has no way to read them back: no restore command and no index. The operator asked (2026-10-18) whether we have tested reading the backups back, for example fetching the logs from a few days selectively. We have not: verification today proves the bytes in Drive match the local ciphertext, not that a bundle decrypts, unpacks, and yields the files someone wants. Untested restore means unproven backup.
