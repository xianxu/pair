# couch: start-up safe mode: no automatic injection into the hub, restart kind reported not acted on, one generic start notice per worker

## Problem

After a restart, Couch acts on its own: it injects system notices into every slot, the hub included ("Couch
restarted and the hub is available…"), and recovery has been attempted automatically at times. The operator (10-20,
drain redesign, ops side doc `2026-10-20-17-drain-redesign.md`): no automatic recovery; a restart may be for
something else, or the setup may be wedged; the operator tells the TL "start recovery" in one line.
