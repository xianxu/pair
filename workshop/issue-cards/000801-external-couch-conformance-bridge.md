# External hold-open Couch conformance bridge

## Problem

parley.nvim#405 needs a real hold-open #758 editor endpoint producer for external Lua conformance. parley.nvim#408 exercised only public adopt-store/direct-store registry commands and did not start a daemon. Pair's cmd/internal/testcouch owns genuine disposable fleets but is a Go testing.TB API, with no external driver entrypoint. Reimplementing its lifetime and teardown in Parley would duplicate authority and risk live-state leakage.
