# mock-to-real app template: per-screen real-or-mock dev router, refusing production build, fixtures contract tests (product-shaping)

## Problem

product-shaping (ops) grows the real app out of its mock screen by screen. In development, unbuilt screens should
still be clickable as mocks; nothing half-mocked may ship.
