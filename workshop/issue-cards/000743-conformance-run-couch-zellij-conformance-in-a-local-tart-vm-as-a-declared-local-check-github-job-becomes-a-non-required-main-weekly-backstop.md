# conformance: run couch-zellij-conformance in a local Tart VM as a declared local check; GitHub job becomes a non-required main/weekly backstop

## Problem

`couch-zellij-conformance` (real Zellij 0.45.1, nvim and PTYs on a clean macOS runner) is a required PR check for
Couch, terminal, launcher and Zellij paths. On 10-20 GitHub's macOS arm64 capacity cancelled it three times before
any runner started ("not acquired by Runner of type hosted"), gating pair landings (#726, #732, #735) on GitHub's
capacity instead of on our tests. The operator's rule is local-first verification.
