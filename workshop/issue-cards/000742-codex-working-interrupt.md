# Couch interrupt refuses a working Codex turn

## Problem

Follow-up to #717 (landed in PR #483): the morning live check reported couch --interrupt refusing a Codex turn that was working. The existing admission proof combines reducer-owned working state, recognized composer, current viewport interrupt hint, and automatic-input ownership. Diagnose which proof is missing from the real Codex path; do not weaken idle/panel/picker or second-interrupt protections to make the working case pass.
